# Data Analysis Coursework (MATLAB) — TMS Dataset Statistical Study

This repository contains a university coursework project in **Data Analysis / Statistics** implemented in **MATLAB**.

## Goal of the project
Using the dataset **TMS.xlsx**, the goal is to study how different experimental factors (e.g., **TMS condition**, **coil type**, **setup**, and stimulation parameters) relate to **ED duration** (`EDduration`).  
The work answers a set of structured questions using:

- Distribution fitting & goodness-of-fit
- Bootstrap-based hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals (parametric vs bootstrap)
- Correlation testing (parametric and randomization test)
- Regression modeling (simple and multiple)
- Feature selection (stepwise regression and LASSO)
- Train/test evaluation (prediction MSE)

This repo is organized as one folder with **exercise scripts** and **helper functions**.
